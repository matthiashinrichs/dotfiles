# dotfiles

This repository contains all the configuration files for the tools I use.

To install the config files you need stow and copy the `.stowrc`-file to `~/.config`.

Then run
```bash
stow .
```

It will symlink all the configs to your ~/.config folder.

## Requirements
You will need some packages installed on your computer. I have prepared install-scripts for that:

On openSuse run:
```bash
./install_opensuse.sh
```
